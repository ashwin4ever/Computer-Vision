**Probelm:**  
To detect peanut flowers from images captured from Peanut farm using Microsoft Kinect mounted on a remote controlled cart.

**Data Information:**
RGB images

**Running the code:**
* Download code *flower_counting.py* and sample images *img1.JPG* and img2.JPG*. Then run the python script to detect peanut flowers.

**Method**  
A Remote Controlled (RC) cart was fitted with Microsoft Kinect and was used to run along a peanut farm to capture images of the canopy. These images were then used to analyze the depth and width of the peanute bushes. Additonally it was used to count the number of flowers in each bush to avoid manual counting by farmers.
